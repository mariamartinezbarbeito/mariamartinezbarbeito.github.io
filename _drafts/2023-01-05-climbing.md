The first time I went rock climbing, I almost cried after climbing 2 meters.

My climbing journey started around December 2019, when I went bouldering for the first time with people from IFISC (side note here, but there are many great climbers at IFISC!). Bouldering was fun, so I started going to the bouldering gym more often. Despite my terrible fear of heights, I loved it. And when I say terrible, I mean the paralizing kind, to the point that I almost cried after climbing 2 meters the first time I went rock climbing. Honestly, I only kept going because I hated the fact that I didn't like it and I wanted to, and because people were nice. Many climbing days looked more like belaying days. Not going to lie, any excuse was a valid excuse.

Flash forward to now, I'm still scared but in control. I still have "I'm going to die" thoughts while climbing, but I can ingnore them (most of the time) and just focus on the moves. There's something very empowering about being able to push through the fear. 

My climbing goals for 2023 are working on my fear of falling, climb 6b (maybe 6c on top rope?), doing a multipitch route, and use more my crashpad.
