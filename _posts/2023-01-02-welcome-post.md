Hello there! My name is María and this is my personal website. 

I'd been thinking about creating a website for a long time. But I never found the time to do it. So, a few weeks ago, I decided that it would be (one of) my 2022 Christmas "break" project(s).

I've created it with the [_Minimal Mistakes_](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme on [_Jekyll_](https://jekyllrb.com). I had zero experience prior to this, so I had to do some research. These are some of the resources that I've used along the way:
- This [post](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/) about installing Ruby on Mac, which wasn't straightforward. 
- This [other post](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/) about installing Jekyll.
- [These YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1itpPvFWHI&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB) were quite helpful to understand the basics of _Jekyll_.
