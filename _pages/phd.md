<!-- This is my PhD page: publications, talks, achievements -->

My PhD journey began in November 2019, when I joined the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems ([IFISC](https://ifisc.uib-csic.es/en/)) in Mallorca, Spain, as a predoctoral researcher under the supervision of [Prof. Pere Colet](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=7BDoa9YAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao) and [Prof. Damià Gomila](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=f1lvcgcAAAAJ&hl=es).

My research focused on the dynamics and stability of power grids in scenarios with a high share of renewable energies. I was initially particularly interested in modeling and analyzing islands' grids. Later, during a research stay at the [Electrical Energy Efficiency Group](https://etranselec.ch) (Switzerland) with [Prof. Philippe Jacquod](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=LaIhRvEAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao), I expanded my work to include larger, continental-scale grids.

In September 2024, I successfully defended my [PhD thesis](https://ifisc.uib-csic.es/media/publications/publication/COFo6GcdQBmGDjL6RZW6_w.pdf) and was awarded the degree with the distinction <em>cum laude</em>.
