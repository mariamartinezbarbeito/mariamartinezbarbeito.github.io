<!-- This is my PhD page: publications, talks, achievements -->

My PhD journey began in November 2019, when I joined the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems (<a href="https://ifisc.uib-csic.es/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IFISC</a>) in Mallorca, Spain, as a predoctoral researcher under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=7BDoa9YAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Pere Colet</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=f1lvcgcAAAAJ&hl=es" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Damià Gomila</a>.

My research focused on the dynamics and stability of power grids in scenarios with a high share of renewable energies. I was initially particularly interested in modeling and analyzing islands' grids. Later, during a research stay at the <a href="https://etranselec.ch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Electrical Energy Efficiency Group</a> (Sion, Switzerland) with <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=LaIhRvEAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Philippe Jacquod</a>, I expanded my work to include larger, continental-scale grids.

In September 2024, I successfully defended my <a href="https://ifisc.uib-csic.es/media/publications/publication/COFo6GcdQBmGDjL6RZW6_w.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PhD thesis</a> and was awarded the degree with the distinction <em>cum laude</em>.
