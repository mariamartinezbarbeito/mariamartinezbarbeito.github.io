I'm María — a physicist with a passion for complex systems and real-world problem solving.

I studied Physics at the University of Santiago de Compostela, spending my final year as an exchange student at the University of Granada. It was there that I first discovered my interest in complex systems.

That experience led me to pursue a Master’s degree in Physics of Complex Systems at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB), where I later completed a [PhD in physics](/phd) focused on the dynamics and stability of power grids with a high share of renewable energy sources.

I’m currently exploring future career opportunities where I can keep learning, contribute meaningfully, and apply my skills to real-world challenges.
