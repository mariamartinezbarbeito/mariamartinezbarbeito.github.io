My name is María Martínez-Barbeito and I'm currently pursuing a PhD in physics at the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems ([IFISC](https://ifisc.uib-csic.es/en/)) in Mallorca (Spain) under the supervision of [Prof. Pere Colet](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=7BDoa9YAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao) and [Prof. Damià Gomila](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=f1lvcgcAAAAJ&hl=es). 

<h5>Background</h5>
I studied physics at the University of Santiago de Compostela (USC) from 2013 to 2018, but I spent the last year of my studies as an exchange student at the University of Granada (UGR), where I discovered complex systems. After that, I got my master's degree in physics of complex systems at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB), which is also where I'm pursuing my PhD. 

<h5>Research</h5>
My PhD research is focused on power grid dynamics and stability in scenarios with a high share of renewable energies. Thus far, I've been modeling and analyzing islands' grids (see [Publications](/publications)). However, I recently moved to larger grids as part of my research stay at the [Electrical Energy Efficiency Group](https://etranselec.ch) (Switzerland) with [Prof. Philippe Jacquod](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=LaIhRvEAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao).

<h5>Other activities</h5>

I like to participate in science outreach events whenever I get the chance (see [Outreach](/outreach)). I believe scientific dissemination plays a crucial role in increasing public visibility and interest in research.

Since April 2022, I'm a member of the Advisory Board of the Young Researchers of the Complex Systems Society ([yrCSS](http://yrcss.cssociety.org)). Among other duties, the Board is responsible for organizing the [warm-up](http://yrcss.cssociety.org/ccs-2022-warm-up/) event before the annual Conference on Complex Systems. 

<h5>Personal interests</h5>
I really enjoy climbing, hiking, and snorkeling (I have to try scuba diving!), and I plan on writing some posts about these activities. I also enjoy baking cakes, so I might write about it too.
