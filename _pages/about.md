My name is María Martínez Barbeito and I'm currently pursuing a PhD in physics at the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems ([IFISC](https://ifisc.uib-csic.es/en/)) in Mallorca (Spain) under the supervision of [Prof. Pere Colet](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=7BDoa9YAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao) and [Prof. Damià Gomila](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=f1lvcgcAAAAJ&hl=es). 

<h5>Background</h5>

I studied physics at the University of Santiago de Compostela (USC) from 2013 to 2018, but I spent the last year of my studies as an exchange student at the University of Granada (UGR), where I discovered complex systems. After that, I got my master's degree in physics of complex systems at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB), which is also where I'm pursuing my PhD. 

<h5>Research</h5>

My PhD [research](/research) is focused on power grid dynamics and stability in scenarios with a high share of renewable energies. I started and have been particularly interested in modeling and analyzing islands' grids. However, since last year, I've moved to larger grids as part of my research stay at the [Electrical Energy Efficiency Group](https://etranselec.ch) (Switzerland) with [Prof. Philippe Jacquod](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=LaIhRvEAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao).

<h5>Other activities</h5>

I actively participate in science [outreach](/outreach) events. I believe scientific dissemination plays a crucial role in increasing public visibility and interest in research. In addition to that, outreach activities enhance my communication skills.

From April 2022 to February 2024, I was part of the Advisory Board of the Young Researchers of the Complex Systems Society ([yrCSS](https://yrcss.cssociety.org)). Starting in July 2023, I also took on the role of Chair of the Board. The Board is responsible for organizing the [warm-up](https://yrcss.cssociety.org/warm-up/) event prior to the annual international Conference on Complex Systems, as well as promoting collaboration among early-stage researchers and supporting other initiatives.


<h5>Personal interests</h5>

I have a really active lifestyle and I've recently joined a triathlon team. I also enjoy hiking, climbing, snorkeling, and baking.
